In this article, we evaluated two numerical methods implemented
in OpenFOAM⃝R concerning their suitability for interface
resolving simulations of submillimetre air-bubbles in water.
The code interFoam implements an algebraic volume-of-fluid
method for a nominally sharp interface with standard continuum
surface force and curvature computations, whereas phaseField-
Foam is based on the phase-field method with diffuse interface
representation with capillary term in free energy formulation.
A nominally static circular bubble surrounded by quiescent liquid
in absence of gravity serves as test case. The two-dimensional
simulations explore the impact in variation of mesh size (h) of the
uniform grid and bubble size. Evaluating the bubble shape, mass
conservation, the Young–Laplace pressure jump and the magnitude
of spurious currents serves as measures for the accuracy of
the solvers.

A reference is drawn to investigations in literature by examining
the solvers on two test cases with simplified conditions,
i.e. matched density/viscosity and an artificially large inviscid drop.
The code interFoam reveals spurious currents not decreasing
with mesh resolution and several orders of magnitude larger than
in phaseFieldFoam, where they decrease with second order convergence.
This convergence is attributed to the absence of curvature
computation, the interface thickness being controlled by the
capillary width (ε) independent from mesh resolution, and an easy
to achieve balanced discretisation between pressure gradient and
capillary term.

In the numerically challenging case of a submillimetre air bubble
in quiescent water, spurious currents remain independent on
the mesh size losing second order convergence in phaseField-
Foam. However, there, the magnitude of the spurious currents
remains five orders in magnitude below interFoam. The large
asymmetric spurious currents in interFoam significantly displace
and deform the bubble especially at higher resolution where the
shape is oscillating, while the bubble remains always circular and
preserving its initial position in phaseFieldFoam. The latter code
predicts the Laplace pressure jump below an error of 1% while
the former underestimates by about 13%. The code interFoam
exhibits very low errors in mass conservation below 0.1% on fine
grids whereas phaseFieldFoam shrinks the bubble in the course
of the simulations while globally conserving the order parameter.
